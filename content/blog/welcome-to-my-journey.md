# The Beginning of Something New

After years of working in the restaurant industry, I've decided to take a leap into the world of artificial intelligence. This blog will document my journey from complete beginner to (hopefully) competent AI practitioner.

## Why AI?

Working in restaurants taught me a lot about:
- **Problem-solving under pressure** - when the kitchen is backed up and customers are waiting, you learn to think fast
- **Pattern recognition** - anticipating customer needs, predicting busy periods, managing inventory
- **Human interaction** - understanding what people really want, even when they can't articulate it

These skills, I believe, will translate surprisingly well to AI and machine learning.

## What I'm Excited About

The things that fascinate me most about AI right now:

1. **Large Language Models** - the way ChatGPT and Claude can understand and generate human-like text is mind-blowing
2. **Computer Vision** - teaching machines to "see" opens up so many possibilities
3. **The democratization of AI** - tools are becoming more accessible to people without PhDs

## My Learning Plan

I'm starting with the fundamentals:

```python
# My first Python print statement!
print("Hello, AI world!")
```

From here, I'll work through:
- Python programming basics
- Mathematics for machine learning (linear algebra, calculus, statistics)
- Data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas
- Machine learning with scikit-learn
- Deep learning with PyTorch or TensorFlow

## Following Along

If you're also transitioning careers or just starting to learn AI, I hope this blog can be helpful. I'll share:
- What resources I'm using
- Mistakes I make (and how I fix them)
- Projects I build along the way
- Honest reflections on what's hard and what's easier than expected

Let's learn together!
